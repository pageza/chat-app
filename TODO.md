# Project TODO List

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **Environment Variables**: Resolved the issue with loading environment variables.
- [x] **Logging**: Fixed the logging issue.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling is now in place.

## Additional Suggestions

- [x] **Middleware Initialization**: You have a TODO comment about moving Redis initialization to a separate function for better readability. It would be good to follow through on that.
- [x] **Code Organization**: Your code is already well-organized into packages based on functionality. You might want to consider further modularization if the codebase grows.
- [ ] **User-related Functionalities**: You have a TODO in the user package for adding more user-related functionalities like updating profiles, password change, etc. This could be a good next step.
- [x] **Configuration Management**: Consider using a configuration management library to handle different environments (development, staging, production).
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure that your code is working as expected. This will also make it easier to add new features in the future.
- [ ] **Documentation**: You might want to add more comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of your code. This will make it easier for other developers (or future you) to understand the code.
- [ ] **API Versioning**: If your application exposes an API, consider adding versioning to the API routes.
- [x] **Rate Limiting and Security**: You already have some middleware for rate limiting, which is great. Consider also adding other security features like input validation, JWT token validation, etc.
- [ ] **Front-end**: Since you're open-minded about front-end frameworks, you might want to start thinking about how you'll build the front-end and how it will interact with your Go backend.
- [ ] **Continuous Integration**: Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Profile your application to find bottlenecks and optimize them.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Prepare your application for deployment. This might involve setting up a Docker container, writing a Kubernetes configuration, or even just compiling your application for your server's operating system.
- [ ] **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Once your application is deployed, you'll need to monitor it to ensure it's running smoothly and fix any issues that come up.
- [ ] **Iterate**: Based on user feedback and monitoring, continue to improve and expand your application.
